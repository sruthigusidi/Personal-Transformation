<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0);" > MENTAL TRANSFORMATION</h2><br>
<h2 style="color: rgb(234, 50, 163);"> Mental transformation is nothing but maintaining your mental health<br>
</h2>
</center>
<h2 style="color: rgb(82, 4, 250);"> What is mental health?</h2><br>
<image src="21.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right";/></image>
<h3 style ="color:white";>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel,
     and act. 
    It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1
     Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.<br>

    Although the terms are often used interchangeably, poor mental health and mental illness are not the same.
     A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise,
      a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of physical, mental, and social well-being.<br>
      
   <b><h2 style="color: rgb(82, 4, 250);"> Why is mental health important for overall health?</h2></b> 
   <image src="19.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right";/></image>
   Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. <br> For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, 
   the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.<br><br>
 <p style ="color:white";>
   <b><h2 style="color: rgb(82, 4, 250);">Can your mental health change over time?</h2></b>
   <image src="20.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right";/></image>
  Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time,
    depending on many factors.  When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities,
     their mental health could be impacted. <br>For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.
